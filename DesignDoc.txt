First, you go to the character creator
Your character has stats:
HP (the amount of health you have)
Attack (strength of a move)
Defense (the amount of magic you have)
Luck (how lucky you are)
Magic (your magic power)

Your character has a level. They start at level 1

Choose your attribute:
Healthy
Wise
Strong
Careful
Lucky
Legendary (hidden)

Then, you get to choose 2 attacking spells:
- Neutral Attack (x2 damage, 1 MP cost)
- Strong Attack (x4 damage, 2 MP cost)
- Risky Attack (x4, double chance to miss)
and 2 supporting spells:
- Magic Healing (restores all of your health, 2 MP Cost)
- Magic Sword (doubles your attack power, 2 MP cost)
- Magic Shield (doubles your defense power, 2 MP cost)
Supporting spells cannot miss


Then, you get to choose 10 out of the following items:
- Health Potion (restores all your health)
- Magic Potion (restores all your stamina)

You crawl across a dungeon. It is set

You can find Healing Potions and Magic Potions in chests (C)

There are random encounters that give you experience

Attack formula is as follows:
- Power of move * attack / defense (min 1)
Precision formula is as follows:
 - (Your luck / opponent's luck) * move precision

You can pull up a menu. This allows you to access:
- items
- stats
- the map
- save

In battle, you can access the items. You can also run, which is a move with 50% luck

Your save data is saved in a .txt file, which is set to not have may read or write access. It will save the characters's zone, location, stats, experience and spells
Run out of HP or magic power and you lose and have to go back to the previous save file

For future plans:
- We want to go up a level every time 100 EXP is gained
- We want to distribute stat bonuses when you level up
- We want to allow the user to switch spells every time they go up a level
- We want to add more enemies with higher levels
- We want to make chests appear procedurally
- We want to make enemies occur more frequently around chests
- We want to add walls to our dungeon to navigate around
- We want to generate those walls procedurally
- We want to allow cancelling during the character creator
- We want to secure our save file
- We want to change the format of the map.txt file to by removing the indicator for which zone is linked with which, and instead, giving the full map of the dungeon and allowing the exploration menu to split it up
- We want to be able to save multiple save files
- We want the unit tests to not need their own files
- We want to print an error message if an input is invalid
- We want to create ascii art
- We want to allow the user to cancel selections
- We want to show the MP cost of moves
- We want to tst the run menu somehow
- We want to generalize unit tests
